# StealthCode: Advanced Military-Grade Communication Tool
![StealthCodeLogo](docs/images/logo.png)
## üìú Overview

**StealthCode** is an advanced secure communication tool that merges **post-quantum cryptography** with **adaptive image steganography** for ultra-secure, stealthy, and future-proof transmission of sensitive information.  
Designed for critical applications like **military operations**, **government communications**, and **corporate confidentiality**, it ensures data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity against emerging cyber and quantum threats.

## üõ°Ô∏è Key Features

- üîê **Authentication & VPN Server**  
  Secure user authentication and IP management over a private VPN network.

- üìö **Quantum-Resistant Encryption**  
  Employs **Kyber Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM)** for key exchange and **ChaCha20-Poly1305** for robust, authenticated encryption.

- üñºÔ∏è **Adaptive Image Steganography**  
  Sophisticated least-significant-bit (LSB) embedding techniques hide encrypted data into carrier images while preserving visual integrity.

- üõÅ **Peer-to-Peer Socket Communication**  
  Secure, low-latency file transmission of both encrypted keys (`key.json`) and stego-images over raw sockets after authentication.

- ‚úÖ **Integrity Verification**  
  Ensures complete and unaltered file transmission.

---
## üî• How It Works (Data Flow)

1. **Authentication Phase (HTTP)**  
   - User logs into the Authentication Server.
   - Upon success, retrieves list of available receivers and selects one.
   - Receives assigned VPN IP.
   - Public Key registered with Cloud Database.

2. **Secure Messaging Phase (Socket Communication)**  
   - Sender fetches receiver‚Äôs Public Key.
   - Message encrypted (ChaCha20), steganographically embedded into an image.
   - `key.json` (containing transmission key and tag) sent first over socket.
   - Then the encrypted stego-image is transmitted via socket.
   - Receiver extracts hidden data, decrypts message using transmission key.

> üî∏ Server communications are HTTP-based.  
> üî∏ Sender-to-Receiver communications are raw Socket-based, secured under VPN.

## üöÄ Setup Instructions


### Setup and Install liboqs

To install liboqs (the Open Quantum Safe library), follow these steps:

#### Clone the repository:
```shell
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs
```

#### Build liboqs:

```shell
cmake -S liboqs -B liboqs/build -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON
cmake --build liboqs/build --parallel 8
cmake --build liboqs/build --target install
```

Note: On UNIX-like systems, you may need sudo for installation:
```shell
sudo cmake --build liboqs/build --target install
```

4. Set up Environment (if needed)

On UNIX-like platforms (Linux/macOS): You may need to add liboqs's library directory to LD_LIBRARY_PATH (or DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH on macOS):

```shell
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib
```
On Windows: Add liboqs to your system‚Äôs PATH:
```shell
    set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files (x86)\liboqs\bin
```
Alternatively, you can configure liboqs to be installed in a custom directory:

```shell
    cmake -S liboqs -B liboqs/build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/liboqs -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON
```

### Install and activate a Python virtual environment

Execute in a Terminal/Console/Administrator Command Prompt

```shell
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade
```

On Windows, replace the line

```shell
. venv/bin/activate
```

by

```shell
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

### Configure and install the wrapper

Execute in a Terminal/Console/Administrator Command Prompt

```shell
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs-python
cd liboqs-python
pip install .
```
### Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository for your stealth code and navigate into the directory:

    git clone https://github.com/abhipnair/StealthCode.git
    cd StealthCode



### Server Configuration

Edit user data for the server: Edit the user_data.json file to add or remove users for your server configuration.

#### Run Server Setup: To configure the server:

```shell
cd Server Configurations
sudo python3 server_config.py
```
#### Start Server Listing: To start the server (use sudo if necessary):

    sudo python3 stealthCodeServer.py

#### Uninstall the Server: To uninstall the server, use the provided uninstall.sh script:

    bash uninstall.sh

### User Configuration

For users running the system:
Go into the virtual environment where liboqs is installed.


#### For starting the software execute

    python3 login.py

**Note: Ensure that you are currently using the venv created and at StealthCode directory.**
